# Business Context

This project addresses the challenge of requiring significant human effort to make consistent classification decisions in tasks such as product categorization and source value mapping — both critical in e-commerce workflows.

Even with sufficient staffing or temporary personnel, maintaining consistency is difficult and costly. This tool enables machines to perform the initial classification work, while trained content specialists focus on fine-tuning and quality control.

To support those specialists, the engine offers a structured, overrideable, and explainable classification process powered by semantic embeddings — delivering strong results even without fine-tuning.

## Key Use Cases

- Mapping internal product taxonomy to external sales channel categories
- Mapping product attributes (e.g., sizes, materials, colors) to standardized values during catalog export
